*Objective*:
      To build a simple rule-based AI chatbot that can understand and respond to user queries using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

*Description*:
      This chatbot was developed using Python and the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library. The chatbot utilizes pattern matching to understand user input and respond           with appropriate predefined answers. It is capable of handling basic interactions such as greetings, questions about its purpose, and polite conversation. The                chatbot runs in the terminal and uses the Chat and reflections classes from the nltk.chat.util module.
